# NLP-sms-spam-detect
## Overview
This project focuses on detecting spam messages using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It employs various text preprocessing methods and machine learning models to classify messages as spam or ham (not spam).
## Features
* Data Preprocessing (Tokenization, Stopword Removal, Lemmatization)
* Spam Detection using Machine Learning Models
* Feature Extraction using TF-IDF
* Model Evaluation with Accuracy and F1-score
* Visualization of NLP Results
## Technologies Used
* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* NLTK, spaCy, TextBlob
* Scikit-learn
* Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn for data handling and visualization
## Usage
* Open Jupyter Notebook:
** jupyter notebook
* Navigate to NLP-SMS-Spam-Detection.ipynb and run the notebook cells sequentially.
* Modify parameters as needed for your dataset.
